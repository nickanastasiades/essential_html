# Essential HTML

## Setup

1. Follow the [Getting Started with GitHub Guide](https://guides.firstdraft.com/getting-started-with-github.html) to download this code to your computer.
1. Open the entire folder in Atom (on Windows, File > Open Folder; on Mac, it's just File > Open, but click Open while you have a folder selected rather than drilling in).

## Tasks

Read through `details.html`, `index.html`, and `new.html` and try to make sense of them. Open them in Chrome and play with them. Click on things. Experiment.

All the other HTML and CSS and Bootstrap and everything else we're going to learn about are fun and empowering, but the contents of this repo are all you **need** to know about HTML in order to move forward.

Now's your chance to ask questions! Ask a question about anything at all that seems fuzzy.
